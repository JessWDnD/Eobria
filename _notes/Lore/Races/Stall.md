**About the Region and People:**  

No-one is completely sure when Stallara first became populated, if you ask the Stall they will tell you they've always been there since their gods first birthed them into the world, records from other regions suggest that they may have migrated from far shore sometime around around 1000 AV.  

The Stall are a theocracy led by Oracles who interpret words of the gods and distribute it to the far edges of the peninsular, they are a superstitious people tied heavily to magic, folklore and mythology.   

The Stall favour lives that allow them to tap into the power of their gods whether good or bad a Paladin might pledge themselves to Stella or one of her demi-god children invoking the powers of the stars to defend themselves, whereas a Warlock might instead seek power from Cambian or one of his dark legion tapping into their darker nature to seek power.  

To some the Stall can seem fanatical putting their complete trust in the Gods and the Oracles interpretations but they are also known for their love of wonderment and incredible folk stories, they are a generous people opening their doors to travelers and refugees to allow them to partake in the blessings their gods have given them.
