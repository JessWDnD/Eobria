Who are the Uvie, a difficult question sometimes even for the Uvie to answer, Ulavon was less settled than repeatedly discovered by run aways looking to shed their past, Kinkara the crater city dates back to around 1051 AV but the nature of the Uvie means it’s difficult to get an exact grasp on their past.  

The Uvie are a secretive society with the land being populated by people with pasts they’d rather forget, a land to start again and become someone new Kinkara also offers anonymity to those who seek it. This attracts older fighters, bounty hunters and smugglers making Kinkara the place to go if you need something someone else owns or you need someone tracked down who’d rather be left alone.  

Their specialty in secrecy makes the Uvie well respected throughout the Veshimier as messengers with old saying being ‘how do you know an Uvie has a secret? You don’t!’. Despite their secrecy the Uvie are known for being extremely respectful of others tolerating all religions and creeds in order to live in relative harmony amongst each other.
