**About the Region:**  

The land of Dragons, the Loth are a proud and insular people who choose not to worship the dead but instead avail themselves of the mighty dragons, the power and magic of the dragons is woven into every aspect of their traditions and life.  

With no need for a central government society on Kiloth society instead focuses itself around guilds setup around the various skills needed on the island with guilds voting internally to select a representative and these representatives bartering on their behalf with other guilds to make sure everyone receives services at a reasonable cost.  

The Loth will dedicate themselves to a dragon and try to emulate it as much as possible for example a follower of the Silver dragon might try to be a prominent member of society to help those around them, a follower of the Amethyst dragon might revel in travelling at sea, some will even pledge themselves to the darker natures of the dragons in return for access to their power.  

The Kiloth have little need for outsiders but the nature of their society means if their trust can be gained they will be a determined and dedicated companion.
