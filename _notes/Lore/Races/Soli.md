**About the Region and People:**  

The Soli are one people and many, tribal in nature they wander the vast plains of Ottigarth searching for resources to sustain them or sell. The Soli by nature have little need for parchment records instead choosing to share their history via oral tradition, what can be gathered from these stories is that some of Soli are likely descendants of the Aedi who became disillusioned or trapped by the idea of city life and chose the life of the travelers. Over the hundreds of years that the Ottigarth has been populated the Soli have grown in number and variety with other nomadic races joining them from the far corners of the Veshimier, the far lands and the far shores.  

Although the Soli choose a restless existence they occasionally set camp in sacred areas like Sibatlas and Solivir named after Slylexisâ€™s twin children, these camps grow and shrink throughout the year depending on festivals and other religious obligations.  

More forgiving than Rikkiotal the desolate plains are still a fearsome opponent for the unprepared and many Soli tap into their animal nature to survive using their gifts to allow them to survive the difficult landscape.  

Traders by nature and a hardy folk the Soli are known to drive a hard but fair bargain, attempting to swindle them is likely to end with a fist fight or an arrow through the leg, despite this the Soli are known for their trustworthiness and once a deal is struck they will often go to extremes to honour it.
