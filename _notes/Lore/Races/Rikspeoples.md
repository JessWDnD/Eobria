**About the Region and People:**  

Rikkiotal is an unforgiving environment with great mesas cresting above scorching desert, and yet the Rikspeoples have create a life for themselves in this hard terrain. Rikspeoples have been noted in the area since as early as XXX AV.  

The difficult lifestyle has left the Rikspeoples with a strange sense of logic, they are great tinkerers, potion makers and spellcrafters because in their own internal logic if it might be possible it must be possible, they will continue almost indefinitely in this vein with trial and error until they achieve their goal an ethos that serves them well in a land that offers nothing for free.  

The Rikkiotal live in circular tower based cities with low ceilings, the reason is twofold, one they take up the least amount of land and by having less distance between floors it takes up less stone to build them; this has led to the curious affect that Rikspeople tend to be short, it’s impossible to say which came first the short people or the low ceilings.  

Rikspeoples can sometimes be thought of as blunt or stupid to people who don’t interact with them regularly as they tend towards the most logical answer rather than the most prescriptive i.e. if you ask a Rikspeoples were they live they will say in their home, if you ask them what they ate for dinner they will say food; this straight forwardness sometimes masks their great ingenuity and skill.
