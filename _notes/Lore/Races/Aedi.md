**About the Region and People:**  

The second oldest region of the Veshimier secondly only to Malanor, the Aedi are the main record-keepers within the Veshimier sending their people far and wide to catalog the changes to the world around them. The Aedi much like the Malanor follow the traditions of the Veshima adopting their calendar and devoting to them as gods.  

Being the first major hub for visitors not from Malanor the city of Obrador has become a melting pot of races for all regions of the Veshimier, and although it is the primary location of Humans they are by no means alone, and with their presence races like Changlings are able to blend in with ease.. With so many people there is a wealth of knowledge, goods and services; there is a saying that if it doesn’t exist in Obrador it doesn’t exist.  

Aedialan is one of the few completely self-sustaining regions of the Veshimier with stone mining in the north, lumber and farmlands in the south and fresh mountain water there is little reason for the Aedi to leave which makes it so ironic that they’re the most likely to be found travelling in another regions.  

The variety of peoples that make up Aedi mean they’re seen as unpredictable to the other regions, they might be friendly or callous, loyal or untrustworthy, the only major defining trait they seem to share is a love for recording knowledge.
