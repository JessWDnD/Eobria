**About the Region and People:**  

The Malanor are the oldest of the peoples of the Veshimier and the only ones known to interact with the Veshima themselves, arriving shortly before the Disappearance the Veshima feature heavily in the lore and history of the Malanor, sometimes called the Seat of the World the Malanor have ruled across their land for thousands of years.  

Malanor stretches far east of the Veshimier, how far only the Malanor know, if you were to ask a Malanor what’s east of the Veshimier they would say Malanor, and if you were to ask them what’s east of Malanor they would say more Malanor. Ruled from the great city of Anthium by their monarchs the Malanor are able to control great distances with easy, a secret they keep well-guarded from the other regions.  

The Malanor are an ancient people more concerned with the old features of the world like trees and mountains than the daily lives of those around them, they tap into natures raw power and wield timeless scrolls of magic to keep their borders safe.  

The Malanor can sometime come off as dispassionate to those with shorter lifespans but they are slow to anger and although they wield unknown power they choose a lifestyle of harmony with those around them rather than expansion like the Broxesians, known for being great healers many an adventurer in despair has been saved by their medical knowledge, a knowledge they’re happy to use to help others but reluctant to teach.
