**About the Region:**   

The nature of the Giros has change substantially in the last twenty-five years of war with the Broxesians, a far smaller force the Giros have had to rely on their skill in creating armour and weapons to give them an advantage in battle, they use superb tactics to control the battle field preferring to strike with deathly accuracy rather than brute force. The land of Giramoss is home to volcanos, rare earths and gemstones, the Giros tap into the magic of the earth to turn the tide of a battle.  

Of course, not all battles can be won by skill alone, so the Giros helped to develop and improve the Warforged to create a renewal army to help defend their land, these Warforged not only proved themselves invaluable but became a part of the very fabric of life in Giramoss.  

The Giros might seem short in patience with those who underestimate their struggles but once on your side they are talented artificers and deadly warriors wielding magic and weapons to their advantage, so great is their dedication to success they will literally sacrifice their own vitality to can the upper hand.  

One day when the war is over the Giros might return to their more peaceful ways creating great works of art from the metal and precious stones they mine.
