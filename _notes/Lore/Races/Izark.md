**About the Region:**  

The White North leading to the Great Frozen Sea is an inhospitable place to live, with great ice sheets and fast water flows, the Izark rely on each other to survive on the limited resources available in their lands and purchase anything they can’t find locally.  

Aarakora, Water and Air Genasi work together to control the skies, the winds and the water in order to control the elements around them and hunt for food, they’re joined by the occasional Aasimar who use the thinner magic field nearer to the north of the world to allow them to descend from the celestial plane.  

A largely socialist society that relies on working together means the Izark can sometimes appear naïve to cons and ruses due to their trusting nature, they make up for it by being excellent trackers and survivalist that any group of adventurers would be lucky to have.
