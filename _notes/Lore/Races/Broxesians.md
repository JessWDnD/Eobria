**About the Region and People:**  

The youngest of the regions in the Veshimier the Broxesians have expanded eastwards from the far lands conquering what they can as they go, records on their arrival are quite detailed stating the first encounters with the Broxesians date back to 1447 AV. Broxesianâ€™s often refer to their homeland as The Great Empire.  

Occupying a large section of western Veshimier the Broxesians are a tough people who relish battle, they ditch traditional beliefs in gods instead they deify great warriors from their past, they will often invoke the name of a great fighter before battle in the hope to gain their favour. The Broxesians follow a devolved military dictatorship with each member taking their day-to-day tasks from their commanding officer, with exceptions made for scouts and spies who are given autonomy to achieve the goals of their military.  

The Broxesians have expanded fast but reached a limit to their expansion due to the vast resources required to keep the warmachine running, they have been engaged in a war for the north of their border with the Giros for the last twenty-five years hoping to secure the forests and eventually the lucrative mines of the Giramoss.  

Although the warmachine ever moves onwards and the Broxesians might seem aggressive to outsiders they are a fair people believing battle should be fought between soldiers where possible and not including civilian causalities, there are many stories of them allowing a fighter whose proven worth in battle to surrender and join their army rather than slaughtering them needlessly.
