Goddess of the sun, life, creation, and harmony Stella is at the heart of all Stallara mythology, in the beginning she created light to allow Eva to be seen, she created the people of the Stallara to populate the land and she blesses them with the gift of creation to further the growth of the Stall.  

Stella has a number of children, Nadar demi-god of time, Kesna demi-goddess of dreams and Orye goddess of luck are some of the most well-known.  

The Stall pray to Stella for a good year ahead, for peace in their families and for wealth and happiness, to honour her they make statues in her likeness
