The main city in [[Aedialan]]

The City of Obrador is a mighty conical city carved deep into the mountains, it's forward facia leads in to deep caverns cut far into the mountain contain all manor of businesses, amenities and institutions.  

The city of Obrador is run via an aristocratic democracy based on guilds, each guild votes for a leader and those leaders meet to make decisions on the running on the city. Corruption rides writhe amongst the more powerful guilds with bribery and blackmail the tools of the trade for securing the best positions.  

The city is cored by a giant circular staircase ([[The Great Staircase]]) wide enough for two carts to travel up and down at the same time and with paths either side for the people to walk, traffic is controlled between the sections with permission passes that allow people to travel where needed and nowhere else; this has lead to a blackmarket of trafficked goods smuggled either through the staircase or via secret passages in the darker regions of the city.  

There are a number of gangs especially in the lower half of the city which specialise in theft, blackmail, forgery, kidnapping for ransom, and smuggling. These gangs control the shadier businesses like locksmiths, identity forgery and the secret routes between the layers that allow people to avoid the Great Staircase.
