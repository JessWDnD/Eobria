The grand staircase sits through the centre of [[Obrador]], opened at each layer to allow traffic in and out is it the main traffic fairthrough for the city.  

Each section has it's own guard checkpoint and pass system, where as many of the lower sections are easy to pass between with commerical passes the upper sections can require negotiation with agencies within the city like the guilds, religious orders or education establishments in order gain access.  

Lit by magical firelight the stairs are open throughout the day and night and it's not uncommon to see a late night cart travelling between layers bringing up the next days trade.
