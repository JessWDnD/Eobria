The region of Aedialan was settled around 850 AV by travellers gathering from across Eobria, the main city in Aedialan is the giant towering [[Obrador]] a hub for trade for the northern regions of the Veshimier.  

Aedialan is bordered in the south by the thick 'Wooden Barrier' forest where boar, deer and elk roam hunted by brown bears, wolfs and panthers, the forest acts as a barrier against the warmer climate of the Ottigarth. Nestled in amongst the Wooden Barrier is the tree ciy of Delmon which acts as the entryway into the region from Ottigarth as well as a convenient place for the Soli to sell their wares.  

On the far side of the forest sits the city of Dori on an estuary of the Puddle Sea where transport boats carry travellers across to Esabelle in Malanor, although smaller than Delmon and Obrador, Dori boast a vibrant fishing market and is the main distributor of seafood into the region.  

Further north across Ghetti's Plain in the rolling hills of Alshills the walled city of Aldani is found, notable as the founding location of the Council of the Veshimier after the One Year War it was here that peace treaty was signed between the Aedi and the Malanor which included ceeding the city of Menvil to the Aedi.  

The right hand side of Aedialan is bordered by the great woods of the Malanor region, the left by the endless mountains that cross the centre of the Veshimier sometimes known as 'The Wall', and in the far north the cold stone gives way to the frozen wastes of the Izactie region.  

In Tarathisk behind the mountains the Aedi secret mines deep into the dark stone for coal, iron and copper ore to help build their cities and on the other side at the bottom of the Obradon 'The Ridge' gives a location to mine precious stone.  

Self-sufficient with its woods, farmlands, fishing, mines and lumber the Aedi have all the main ingredients to allow them never leave the region but despite this many an Aedi has struck forth into the Veshimier searching for clues to the history of the Veshima and the other people of the continent.
